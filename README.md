# Introduction to Class Variables and Methods in Ruby

Classes are like the skeleton from which individual objects are created and
class variables are available across different objects. So far, we've primarily
created instance methods.

In the next several lessons we'll be taking a look at:

* How to recognize a class constant
* Utilizing class constants
* Knowing when to use attr_accessor vs creating the methods manually
* Use cases for defining private and protected methods
* The difference between public, private, and protected methods
* Using class variables to keep track of data pertaining to a class
* The concept of remembrance in object-oriented programming

At a glance, you might assume a class variables work like instance variables,
however this is not the case. In this section, we'll distinguish the difference
between class methods and variables and when to use them.
